Code_Wars
Hey there, my name is Saladin and I'm a Codam College student.
This is my collection of all the Code Wars kata that I've completed.
There still needs to happen a lot, for example;
	adding my own testers
	norminette proofing //making the code readable and uderstandable
	refactoring code
	figure out how criterion works and how i can use that in my own environment

maybe I'll also divide all the exercises in the different dificulties!

Happy coding!

Half of the time I'm streaming Code Wars kata on this twitch channel:
